# NMA Web Site - Version 3

NMA Web Site - Version 3 (2016-2020) 
* Single page, static site
* Currently at [https://kccnma.site](https://kccnma.site)
* Also accessible via [http://nma.kcc.hawaii.edu](http://nma.kcc.hawaii.edu) (redirect)
* Built with [Prepros](https://prepros.io/)
* Deployment requires a manual upload via FTP (see Chris for more details on this)

## To edit locally
* Download or clone the repo to your local computer
* Add it to [Prepros](https://prepros.io/)
* Edit index.kit for the content (compiles to .html)
* Eit *.scss files for styling (compiles to .css)

## Other Notes
* Chris's Prepros config file is not uploaded to GitHub because it has the private FTP credentials within it
* The repo is currently set to private because it used to (and may still have) some private API keys exposed (Chris needs to double-check this to verify)
